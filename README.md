# Inspiration 


There are various platforms which runs gaming tournaments but all of them face the problem of trust. As some tournaments have huge prizes there is always a chance of malicious actors. Centralized entity are somewhat dependent on a single person for critical transactions. We are here to change that. We provide gaming tournaments in our flagship games in a decentralized manner. 

We believe that in game assets and rewards will become a major driving point for the NFT ecosystem. We want to be on the forefront of this innovation. A major market in gaming is the e-sports market and while the big e-sports generate a lot of hype but there is a lot of value in small events too. Capturing both the markets become very important.


## Innovation

We wanted to create a platform that leverages the power of Blockchain and NFT‚Äôs to empower users as well as leverage NFT's  to offer a unique solution to the users. We decided to take a targeted approach and targeted utility based nft that can offer users value for money. Gaming has been around for a long time and new utilities for gaming are getting discovered. We have utilized NFT's to extract there powers.
